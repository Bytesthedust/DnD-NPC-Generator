# DnD-NPC-Generator
A simple NPC generator for Dungeons and Dragons

## Name Generation
The names are generated from two text files, nameList and surname, that are combined in a function to return a full name. The names were chosen at random from the sources listed below. As of March 2024, the script can generate about 39,256,490 names (39,262,756 w/ repetition)

## Personality
Personality is sourced from a text file called personalityList containing personality traits. A function will chose three traits at random. In the future version, a section of the generator will be added to provide definitions to the traits

## Age Group
Age is catagorized into three groups; Young Adult (18+), Middle Age, and Old. Because of the varying lifespans of D&D races, these ages are respective of each lineage. In a future version, an age range respective of each race will be displayed alongside the age group
